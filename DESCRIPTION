Description: A not uncommon task for quants is to create 'waterfall charts'. There seems to be no simple way to do this in 'ggplot2' currently. This package contains a single function (waterfall) that simply draws a waterfall chart in a 'ggplot2' object. Some flexibility is provided, though often the object created will need to be modified through a theme.
